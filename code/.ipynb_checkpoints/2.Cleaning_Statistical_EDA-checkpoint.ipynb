    "## Interpretation of Statistical EDA and Visualizations:\n",
    "Our summary stats tell us that we have a reasonably well distributed variety of clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clause Types**: The histogram shows that there are 10 `clause types` that range between 600-900+ observations even after removing invalid rows. This means we will not have terribly imbalanced classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clause Word Count**: For all clause types, we see that the distribution is heavily skewed right/left leaning. Visually, we see that most clauses tend to have fewer than 200 words.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Some clauses are also way more verbose, and it's interesting to see that `confidentiality` clauses tend to have more words (a median of `224` words) - this is probably reflective of the fact that a lot has to be written around describing the protection of sensitive information and data in modern contracts. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    What's also interesting is that the many clauses have a second \"hump\" or peak (bimodal) distribution, with a significant minority of `warranty`, `compliance`, `confidentiality` and other clauses have outlier clauses that are written with as many as ~350-425 words. This reflects the fact that many, many contracts are still written verbosely and not plainly/in \"legalese\"."
